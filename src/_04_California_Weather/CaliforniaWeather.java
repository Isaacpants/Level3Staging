 * 2. Create a way for the user to specify the weather condition and then
 * list the cities that have those conditions.
 * Example: User: Mostly Cloudy
 *          Program: Long Beach, Pomona, Oceanside, ...
 * 
 * 3. Create a way for the user to enter a mimimum and maximum temperature
 * and then list the cities that have temperatures within that range
 * Example: User: minimum temperature °F = 65.0, max temperature °F = 70.0
 *          Program: Fortana, Glendale, Escondido, Del Mar, ...
 *          
 * EXTRA.
 * Feel free to add pictures for specific weather conditions or a thermometer
 * for the temperature. Also If you want your program to get the current day's
